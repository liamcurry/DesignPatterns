## ELI5

At bath time, mommy or daddy draws the batch for you. And when they say it's
ready, you jump in, and have a great time trying to get as much bath water out
of the tub as possible.

Have you ever tried to draw a bath by yourself, though? They're more to it than
just flipping the water on. You have to keep the drain open, testing the water
until the temperature is just right, adjusting the knob when needed. Once the
temperature is where you'd be comfortable, it's time to plug the drain, pour in
the bubble bath, and watch the water level until it's high enough (but not too
high). Then you turn the water off, and you're done!

But you don't have to worry about all that. Mommy or Daddy does this for you.
In this, your parent is acting as a **facade**, and performing a complex series
of steps or operations for you. All you have to do, is tell Mommy or Daddy that
you're ready for a bath. They do all the work of getting the bath ready.
