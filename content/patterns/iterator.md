## ELI5

When reading or looking through a book, do you think of the page after the one
you're on by its number (i.e. page 6)? Or, do you only think of it as the next
page? Let's say you remembered a fun picture that you wanted to look at on the
last page you were on. Do you look at the page number of the page you're on now,
and then flip pages until you reach that page number, minus one? Or, do you say
to yourself, "I want the page before this, so I'll go back one."

Sometimes, it doesn't matter to keep track of things like this, where the pages
are kept in order by the book binding, and you can use your fingers to flip to
the next, or previous, page. The **Iterator** pattern is shown here. You are
able to go from the beginning of this book to the end, without worrying about
how the pages are ordered or indexed. You just flip to the next page when
you're ready.
